The Appellate Body, the highest court in the World Trade Organization (WTO), has lost its ability to make judgment. The Body normally consists of a panel of seven judges but in recent years has dwindled to three. Now, as of December 10th, two of the last three judges’ terms have expired; leaving only one judge on the court. Court rules state that it must have a minimum of three judges in order to judge cases. This leaves many feeling a sense of chaos and feel like global trade is now, as former WTO appellate judge, Peter Van den Bossche put it, “the law of the jungle.” So, why did this happen and what does this really mean for global trade?

The Appellate body, formed along with the WTO in 1995, has been losing members since the George W. Bush Administration and has carried on through both Obama and Trump administrations. Each president has felt the WTO mistreats the United States in how in they conduct business and has refused to nominate nor approve nominations of new judges in protest.
