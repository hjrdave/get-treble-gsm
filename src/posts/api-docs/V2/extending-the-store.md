As your app grows so does global state, which in can make the Store get hard to navigate and maintain.  Extending the Treble Store is a feature that allows seperate and external Stores to be included in another Store. This means we can break up a huge Store and create seperate Stores that might house specific state. We could have a Store for UI specific state and another Store for api specfic state. Both of these stores can be included in another Store.
