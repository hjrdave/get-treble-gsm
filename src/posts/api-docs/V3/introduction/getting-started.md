It is TrebleGSMâ€™s goal to provide an easy and quick setup.  Below are the steps needed to get TrebleGSM installed and setup in your app, so you can start managing state like a boss!

Install
First install TrebleGSM in your app.  You can get more information about this package from npm or yarn. Node.js must be installed on your system. You can download node.js here.

Create a Store
First create a `Store.js` at the top level of your app folder structure. In `Store.js` you will import the function createStore from treble-gsm.  Assign createStore to a variable called Store. Example Below.

Add State Objects to the Store
The createStore function takes an array of objects as its first parameter.  Each object has an `action` property and a `state` property. 

The `action` property acts as a string key identifier that allows TrebleGSM to identify which state to manage when the Store is subscribed to.  The `state` property takes an object key value pair that will hold the state property and default value. Example below.

State Provider
The `Treble` component is the context provider that gives nested components access to the Store. Import `Treble` into your `App.js` or `Index.js` and wrap around all components. `Treble` has a prop called `store`. Import `Store` from `Store.js` into the page and pass it to the `store` prop. Example Below.

Treble is now setup in your app! Easy as Sugar Creme Pie!
