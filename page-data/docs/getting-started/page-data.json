Even though React.js manages local state well, when state needs to be shared amongst components, methods like prop-drilling must be used.  Prop-drilling causes huge performance issues as every component the prop (drills) passes through is re-rendered when state changes.</p>\n<p>Global state is a method of centralizing state in an app.  A data store is used to house state that will be shared amongst the components that subscribe to it. By using this method to manage state, prop-drilling is no longer necessary as each component has access to the store.  When a certain state in the store updates only the components that use that state will re-render. This makes state management more maintainable and greatly improves application performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-treble\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#why-treble\" aria-label=\"why treble permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why Treble?</h3>\n<p>Treble is a global state management library inspired by a <a href=\"https://medium.com/simply/state-management-with-react-hooks-and-context-api-at-10-lines-of-code-baf6be8302c\">blog post</a> by <a href=\"https://medium.com/@luke.hall\">Luke Hall</a>. Treble utilizes React's Context and Hook's API to provide powerful state management to React apps. Treble's goal is to provide a simple way to manage global state in your React app by providing an easy setup, little boilerplate, and a straight forward API. All of this so the developer can manage state with confidence!</p>","excerpt":"As React apps scale, managing state can become complicated and hard to maintain.
